            <div class="data">
            <p>     
                Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in 1940 in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, and was named after Thomas Edison. He was originally nicknamed "Dico" and received the nickname "Pelé" due to his pronunciation of Bilé's name. Pelé played for several amateur teams in his youth, including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Ameriquinha, and was part of the first futsal (indoor football) competition in the region.

            <div class="data">
                <p> After signing for Santos, Pelé became the leading goal scorer in the Brazilian club's history. He also led them to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores titles.

                    The superstar received a number of offers from European clubs but Brazilian President Jânio Quadros declared him a national treasure making it difficult for him to ply his trade in another country.
                    
                    In 1975, Pelé agreed to a $7 million contract with the New York Cosmos for a year and made the NASL a big attraction.

            <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">International success</h3>
            <ul class="py-4">
                    <li><b>1958 World Cup</b>Pelé became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final at 17 years and 249 days, scoring two goals in a 5-2 victory over Sweden. Pelé was the first black global sporting superstar and was awarded the Silver Ball for the 1958 World Cup due to disorganization. </li>
                    <li><b>1962 World Cup</b>Pelé was considered the best player in the world at the 1962 World Cup, but was injured in the first game and forced coach Aymoré Moreira to make a lineup change. It was Garrincha who carried Brazil to their second World Cup title, with Pelé receiving his winner's medal retroactively in 2007.</li>
                    <li><b>1966 World Cup</b>Brazil was eliminated from the 1966 World Cup due to brutal fouls on Pelé, leading to his decision to never again play in the tournament.</li>
                    <li><b>1970 World Cup</b>Pelé's 1970 World Cup squad is considered the greatest in history, led by the front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gerson, Tostão, and Rivelino. Pelé scored two goals in the 1970 World Cup, including a 20-yard bending free-kick, and made a famous play in the semi-final against Uruguay. He also made assists for Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto.</li>

                <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">Style Of Play</h3>

                <div class="data">
                    <p>Pelé was a prolific goalscorer and team player, known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot. He was also a hard-working team player and a complete forward, with exceptional vision and intelligence. He played in a variety of attacking positions, including inside the penalty area, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. His unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. He also excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy, timing, and elevation. His warm embrace of Bobby Moore following the Brazil vs England game at the 1970 World Cup is viewed as the embodiment of sportsmanship.
